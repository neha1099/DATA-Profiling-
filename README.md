# DATA-Profiling-
During a recent project, I developed a comprehensive data analysis and visualization tool using Python, specifically leveraging the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries.
The primary goal was to provide an automated analysis of a given dataset. Here's a brief overview:
1.	Data Loading: The tool begins by ingesting data from a specified CSV file.
2.	Data Summary: It provides a holistic summary of the data, giving insights into basic statistics and properties.
3.	Data Type Detection: The tool identifies the data type of each column, helping in determining how to best process and visualize it.
4.	Unique Values: It calculates the number of unique entries in each column.
5.	Frequent Values: The tool also pinpoints the top 'N' frequent values in each column, providing a quick insight into the most common data points.
6.	Visualization: Depending on the data type, the tool visualizes each column. For numeric data, it generates histograms, and for categorical data, it presents bar charts.
This tool essentially serves as an initial 'exploratory data analysis' tool, helping users quickly understand the nature and distribution of their data.
